# Music Generation with Vanilla GANs and Autoencoders


Welcome to our music generation project using Vanilla GANs and Autoencoders! This repository contains code and resources for training and generating music using the GTZAN dataset.

## Introduction

In this project, we explore the fascinating realm where artificial intelligence meets musical creativity. We leverage Vanilla Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Autoencoders to generate music samples based on the GTZAN dataset. Our goal is to push the boundaries of music generation by experimenting with different architectures and training strategies.

## Features

- Train Vanilla GANs and Autoencoders on the GTZAN dataset for music generation.
- Generate new music samples using trained models.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow 
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- librosa (for audio processing)
